/** Various complex interfaces.
  *
  * Complex interfaces are collections controlling several other
  * collections.
  *
  * The lightest complex collections maintain single collections with
  * a title (a Mark). They only offer a tidy way to look after small
  * collections. Much the same effect could be achieved by consistent
  * naming of single collections.
  * 
  * The heavier complex collections may maintain several tables with
  * complex interaction. As a mid-level example, image can edit a
  * collection of images, stored in a folder, while also offering an
  * API for saving information on the image to a database.
