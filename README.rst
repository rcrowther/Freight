Gear
====
``Freight`` is a Unix/Scala program. It has little use for non-Scala users. It's probably a bad idea to think of converting ``Freight``  for other uses. You'll be regarded as unprofessional, and that's worth a mortgage.


``Freight`` is a load of gear I would like. I'll tell you more as I get it where I want it. 


``Freight`` is a library, but compilation and delivery has not been worked out.




Usage
=====
Needs
-----
Java and Scala. Both standard, OpenJDK is fine.

``Freight`` is designed to be the handle of the blade, not the cutting edge. Every blade needs a handle. ``Freight`` may even work in packaged environments.

``Freight`` likes some additional libraries. If they're small, they may be included in the upload.


Building
========
I don't like build tools, and have no base to distribute Java .jar files. So building is by ``ssc``.

It may be possible to coax SBT into compiling ``Freight``. The base folders will need re-arranging. If Maven or other Java devices are your bag, I guess you know what you need to do. Otherwise, steer clear.

So?
===
As ``Freight`` gear and APIs settle (maybe that should be 'if'), I'll list them.
