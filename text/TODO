Can we maro those transformers or not?

Needs an interface locking system.

Do I need those timestamp/times now? (do they occur in dataases or interfaces, that's the question - Answer: in JDBC)
Do we need ASCII string? As well as the short string (vs text)?

= packages
Cleanup generic? Core.objects.generic.CanGive can go now?

What about the id problem? Can't be in GenGivable cause that's for Giver types too...

package iface likely CAN be 'interface' or 'interfaces'
