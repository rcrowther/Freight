== Ways of looking at Freight

- The all-time insane use of visitors
- An ORM without the 'R'
- A rubbish version of '' with tacky programming
- Programming for the unprofessional


== JDO
One way of regarding freight is as a JDO (Java Data Objects),

https://db.apache.org/jdo/index.html

JDO is a system where, by enhancing classes with annotations and extra gear, clases can be made to persist. Some differences between JDO and freight,

JDO is
- professional, heavily developed, Java-weight softare
- offers a huge range of types
- compared to most similar systems, is unobtrusive.

Freight is
- without the weight of professional code
- deliberqately ugly
- unhinged, or generalized, depending on your outlook. Any interface is fair game, and already includes 'cron' and a servlet

The author might add that freight lacks Java-style documentation, which the author regards as a relief.
